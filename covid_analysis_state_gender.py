Date: September 11, 2020. 

This is a correlation analysis, searching for the factors associated with
 ICU (Intensive Care Unity) usage by state,
in the people infected with Covid-19 in Mexico.

The Covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered 
coronavirus. On March 11 of 2020,the World Health Organization declared the 
virus COVID-19 a Pandemic. Currently, on September 2020, there are more than 
27,000,000 of people infected around the world. In Mexico, there are almost 
650,000 and it ranks number 4 in deaths. 

The informtaion used in this analysis, was taken from Mexico's ministry of 
health website:

The correlation analysis will be gruped by state (I have took the state
of residence from the COVID database), and others groups wil be considered too, like 
the age and gender.
